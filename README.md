## Files present:
- "autonomy_info_classes.pdf" - PDF of the AeroAstro autonomy specialization
- "Field_Exam_Description.pdf" - PDF of all the field exam (FE) descriptions. Need to become extra proficient in those fields.
- "FE_AU_20XX.pdf" - the field exams I could find online. These need worked

## General subjects to study:
- go inside "Field_Exam_description.pdf" for more comprehensive list of stuff here
- All levels of traditional/classic/modern optimal/predictive/feedback control
- Estimation, model predictive control, stochastic estimation/control
- State-space models for control and observability
- I need projects doing typical controllers such as LQR, LQI
