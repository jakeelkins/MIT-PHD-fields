# MIT-PHD-fields
a spot for me to put the docs, notes, and deadlines I need to keep track of and get good at if I want to be an MIT boi

## Files present:
- "autonomy_info_classes.pdf" - PDF of the AeroAstro autonomy specialization, detailing classes I'd need to take and stick around
- "Field_Exam_Description.pdf" - PDF of all the field exam (FE) descriptions. I'd take the autonomy FE, about midway through the doc. Need to become extra proficient in those fields.
- "FE_AU_20XX.pdf" - the field exams I could find online. These need worked

## General subjects to study:
- go inside "Field_Exam_description.pdf" for more comprehensive list of stuff here
- All levels of traditional/classic/modern optimal/predictive/feedback control
- Estimation, model predictive control, stochastic estimation/control
- State-space models for control and observability
- I need projects doing typical controllers such as LQR, LQI






## Questions:
- do you take classes before the FE? What's that timeframe?
- When do I contact potential advisors?
